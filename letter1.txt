Yooo I finally did it!!!! 
I had no hopes I would be able to make this whole website thing. Last night, I was lying awake with random thoughts running in my mind, when this idea struck me: I have no idea when I will be able to post actual handwritten letters to you, so why not make a webiste that can mimic the same? But I sort of overestimated myself. The first time I did HTML was my last mail to you. So this was an amibitious project for me. Let me know what you think of it:) And any new ideas will be very welcome (I am kind of enjoying making this, despite the tangled codes).

(Wait, can I paste an image in a text file?? Tried: No, they are 'text' files for a reaon🥲 Will attach separately)

Namaste is a very nice greeting in itself🙏🏽. Hippity-hoppity, boop, knock-knock is something I would send when I am feeling a little eccentric (I feel eccentric often when I am with friends). The Japanese Food Culture webinar sounds fun! I am curious how people have so much information on things like these. Sadly, I can't attend it :/ I will be at the summer school at that time. 

These days I have been doing a lot of things except studying. My house had become a zoo for a few days cause my little cousin and his parents, and my sister were all here. That boy is a unique character xD as all little kids are. He is nine years younger to me, and he treats me like I am just a class above him-_-. He is quick with words and doesn't pause before saying "tedhe" remarks to anyone, even his parents. The 3 of us had a delicate peace initally, but then he did some edits to one of my painitngs, which is when we finally had a showdown. (Sending evidence of his crimes)

In midst of all this toofan, my mom wanted to do a pooja since all of us were together after a long while. So for a brief moment we all had a truce to help with the housework a little. But then he had to leave for his Nani's house. Now I sort of miss him :] (Not for long tho, he will be back in a day and we will continue our fight)

That was my life update. Very ideal for someone doing exam prep, right🤐? Compared to this, I get a lot more done in a day at campus. In the 3rd year, the earliest I woke up was 9 am 🥲 I would then attend classes, have lunch and be back at room. I used to study in the library in the 2nd year, and I really liked it. But in the last 2 semesters, my room felt more comfortable. But I am thinking of switching back to the library starting next sem, cause I think I study with more focus there. In evenings, I used to go for a walk or chai with my friends. This is what happened during 'normal' days. During days leading up to any major Book club events, a large part of my day would go into organizing it. It would be accurate to say that my top priorities in third year were the Book Club and my friends. Studies had taken a back seat. But I feel satisfied with it. I would not have it any other way. 

Also, YES! I have tried the NYTimes Games. Tejal introduced me to them, and we use to solve the Wordle quite regularly (especially sending each other stats during the 9 am classes which were boring) And later on, one of our club members conducted the Connections game with a bookish game at our Literary Circle. It was sooo fun! My favorite game to play with friends is UNO though :D We have so many lores now (some not favourable to me, so wont be revealing🙂‍↔️) Do you play UNO? Do you enjoy it? I tried video games this semester with a senior at the club. I am awful at them, even Mario games. But it is fun and satisying to watch someone else play them ;) I am also bad at playing games that involves catching stuff. 

That shop with electronic token is mind-blowing! So much better than the blaring buzzers at Ideation. Going to catch a bus without knowing which one is crazier😭 But it is fun if you are doing stuff like this with people your age- such events add a fun element to the journey (fun in retrospect I suppose). Do you usually believe in astrology and horoscopes? I don't. I find them entertaining at max. Have you seen Encanto? Bruno gets outcast from his family because his predictions were unsettling, however accurate. So even if they are correct, I don't like reading horoscopes. 

My sister also wanted to take up B.Arch at some point! This interest lasted for atmost a week, and was mostly due to the art work. The moment she realised that it is much more than that, she lost interest -_-. What made you interested in B.Arch? As a kid, I wanted to become a scientist at ISRO. This motivaed me to study Physics really well in class 6 (Funnily, my cousin says the same thing right now🥹). Unfortunately, I got the worst Physics teacher at school, in all classes uptil 12th, so I started loosing interest. And this disinterest later morphed into some irrational fear of the subject. I have always got decently good marks in the subject, but I keep feeling that I never truly understand or develop intuition for it. My mom is AFRAID of mathematics! She used to be scared of the subject since the time she was taught Hour Seconds, Rupee paise conversions. So irrational fear of subjects might be genetic in me lol.
What is your least favorite subject?

I did not hurry to make a decision on what major to take after 2nd year, though usually I get all panicky about decisions. I was confused between Data Science and CS, so I did an internship in the topic that I was always drooling over in Data Science: Computer Vision, and...I did not enjoy it. I found it very experimental and the theory was not very convincing. On the other hand, I attended a summer school on Theory CS, and I absolutely loved their problem statements and the approaches to solving them♡ (Its been 2 weeks since our last meeting, my PI is not replying😭)

I enjoy watching animated movies. I find them quite meaningful honestly. People expect them to be meaningless, that kids cannot understand complex messages, but these movies do a very good job at conveying things that are hard to put into simple statements at the end of a moral-teaching story. Two of my favorites are Leap! and How to Train Your Dragon. I watched Paprika with a friend in Patiala. It was late December, a cold cold winter day, and we watched it buried in our blankets. So my love for it also draws from the memory of watching it with a friend. 

YouTube recommendation: Artist Pages. I like how their motto is "Champion Living Artists". Btw, Drew Talbert's videos have so many characters that I got a bit confused >.< But really, he is a good actor. 

Some thoughts on food: I don't like Khaman (which I though was Dhokla🥲) I don't like Idli. I like dosa. I WANT TO TRY BARAF KA GOLA!! My mom never let me have them on the way back from school TT^TT.

Hoping for you to get THE Vada Pav at Mumbai,
Astha
